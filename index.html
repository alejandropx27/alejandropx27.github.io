                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Alejandro Perez, I am a high school senior pursuing higher education in Computer Science. My interest in computers all started when I was in fifth grade and got my first laptop. I was left to my own devices and learned how to navigate Windows and its console. Of course, I wasnâ€™t a master at it at first. When I happened to get ransomware for some family photos on my laptop I had to figure things out before my parents found out. After a week of attempts, I managed to fix my laptop without anyone being the wiser.</p>
                    <p>I became more and more familiar with the technical side out of necessity as I learned how computer programs functioned until moving on to computer hardware. I taught myself through Youtube videos how to build a PC and perform maintenance. Finally, in my Junior year of high school I began the Information Technology CTC program.</p>
                    <p>Now, I pursue software engineering at a four year university to expand my knowledge and repertoire of technical computer knowledge in programming, networking, and computer assistance.</p>
